    <header><u>Introduction</u></header>
    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
</li>
      <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
      </ul>

      <header><u>What you should already know</u></header>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
</br>
    <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
      <header><u>JavaScript and Java</u></header>
      <p>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
    </section>
</br>
    <section class="main-section nav-link" id="Hello_world">
      <header><u>Hello world</u></header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <div id="three">
      <code>
        function greetMe(yourName)<br>
        { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>
        greetMe("World");
        </code></div>
    </section></br>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header><u>Variables</u></header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
    </section><br>
    <section class="main-section" id="Declearing_variables">
      <header><u>Declearing variables</u></header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <div id="one">
      <code>
        var x = 42.
      </code></div>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
      <div id="one">
        <code>
        x = 42.
        </code></div>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <div id="one">
      <code>
        let y = 13.
      </code></div>
    </section></br>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
      <header><u>Variable Scope</u></header>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
        </p>
      <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
      <div id="one">
      <code>
        if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
        </code></div>
    </section></br>
